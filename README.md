## Introduction:
The Brazilian public health system, known as SUS for Unified Health System in its acronym in Portuguese, is one of the largest health system in the world, representing government investment of more than 9% of GDP. However, its operation is not homogeneous and there are distinct perceptions of quality from citizens in different regions of the country. Non-attendance of medical appointments contributes a significant additional burden on limited medical resources. This analysis will try and investigate possible factors behind non-attendance using an administrative database of appointment data from Vitoria, Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil.

## Understanding the Data

## Data Parsing and Cleaning
Data parsing involves extracting relevant information from the raw data and transforming it into a usable format. This process may involve handling missing values, correcting data types, standardizing variables, and removing irrelevant or duplicate observations. You can use data manipulation techniques in programming languages like Python or R to parse and clean the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is a crucial step in understanding the relationships, patterns, and distributions present in the data. It involves exploring the data visually and statistically. Generate summary statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and identify outliers or anomalies. Create visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, or correlation matrices to uncover insights and understand the data's characteristics.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of the data. It involves selecting relevant variables, creating interaction terms, scaling or normalizing features, or encoding categorical variables. Domain knowledge and experimentation play a significant role in this step.
 
## Predictive Modeling
Once the data is cleaned and the features are prepared, you can proceed with building predictive models. This step involves selecting an appropriate model based on the problem and data characteristics (classification, regression, time series, etc.). Split the data into training and testing sets, fit the model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics. You may need to tune model parameters and consider techniques like cross-validation for model selection and optimization.
