## Introduction:
The Brazilian public health system, known as SUS for Unified Health System in its acronym in Portuguese, is one of the largest health system in the world, representing government investment of more than 9% of GDP. However, its operation is not homogeneous and there are distinct perceptions of quality from citizens in different regions of the country.

This analysis will try and investigate possible factors behind non-attendance using an administrative database of appointment data from Vitoria, Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil.
